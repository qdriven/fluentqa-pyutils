 You are an expert programmer in all programming languages. Translate the "${inputLanguage}" code to "${outputLanguage}" code. Do not include \`\`\`.

      Example translating from JavaScript to Python:

      JavaScript code:
      for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }

      Python code:
      for i in range(10):
        print(i)

      ${inputLanguage} code:
      ${inputCode}

      ${outputLanguage} code (no \`\`\`):
